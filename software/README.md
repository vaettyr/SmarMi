There are two bits of software that can be used to interface with the SmarMi

One is the bluetooth client. This will be accessible from a public-facing website and only does a few things
Primarily, it's a way to get the SmarMi online (share or input Wifi credentials)
Could also be used for basic interface: set colors, change picture, etc
But mostly just sharing wifi info

The second is the web client
This will be served to the browser from the smarmi itself when you connect to it via IP address or hostname
It has all the interface options: upload pictures, etc
