// need to flesh this out a lot
// but this is where I think the majority of the code will live to keep the ino file simple

// read button state
// display menu
// maybe each state exists in it's own file that implements a common interface

// interfaces are:

// directory browser / navigator to load files from sd to display
// initializing screen
// default display (show loaded images)
// bluetooth pairing
// wifi connect (can expose a page user can interact with?)
// being read as usb msc
