# SmarMi
Firmware and Software for the Smart Miniature (SmarMi)

Notes

Used Adafruit_SPIFlash -> SdFat_Format to format the onboard flash as FAT12 (because it's so small)
It handles it automatically by defines based on the board type
The DISK_LABEL param is what it will show as when mounted on PC (or wherever)
